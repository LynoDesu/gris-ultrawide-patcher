# Gris ultra-wide patcher

This is a simple patcher for Gris to enable ultra-wide resolutions.

This is achieved by patching UnityPlayer.dll and currently supports the following fuctionality:
- Enabling 2560x1080 resolution
- Enabling 3440x1440 resolution
- Reverting back to unpatch/widescreen state

## Getting Started

The patcher is written in Flutter & Dart and targets Windows, macOS and Linux. 

I will be soon posting release files once I have time to build and sign them, but for now you can build them from source.
